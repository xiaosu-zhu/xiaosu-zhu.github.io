Currently, I'm a Ph.D. student in [**Center for Future Media**](https://cfm.uestc.edu.cn/index) and School of Computer Science and Engineering of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China ([**UESTC**](https://www.uestc.edu.cn)), supervised by [**Prof. Jingkuan Song**](https://cfm.uestc.edu.cn/~songjingkuan/) and [**Prof. Lianli Gao**](https://lianligao.github.io). My research interests lie in compact representation learning, multimedia retrieval and compression. Now, I've published 5+ papers on **CVPR, ACM SIGIR, ACM MM, IJCAI, etc**.

Earlier, I recieved my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from UESTC in 2017. During this time, I learned a few programming languages and developed some small apps including [**Aurora Music**](https://github.com/xiaosu-zhu/Aurora.Music), which was selected as the finalist of **Design Innovator of the 2018's Windows Developer Award**.

I'm happy to discuss with anyone interested in my works. Please don't hesitate to contact me via [GitHub](https://github.com/xiaosu-zhu) or [Email](mailto:xiaosu.zhu@outlook.com).
